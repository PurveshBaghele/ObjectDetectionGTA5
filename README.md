# ObjectDetectionGTA5
Implemented object detection using Tensorflow's object detection API and used it in GTA V

The only code needed is in grabscreen.py and vehicleDetection.py .
For the rest of the part, follow the instructions from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md
and place the grabscreen.py and vehicleDetection.py files in research\object_detection directory.
